# PIPELINE #
############

# General purpose:
#   SUBNAME: Unique, case-sensitive substring to search for in filenames
#   SAMPLE: Sample name you want to give to the files found (no whitespace)
# For Trimmomatic:
#   TRIM_THREADS: 
#   HEADCROP: Number of nucleotides to remove from start of reads
#   LEADING: Remove bases from start of read below this threshold quality
#   TRAILING: Remove bases from end of read below this threshold quality
#   SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform sliding window trimming, cutting when the average
#                  quality within the window falls below a threshold (format
#                  <window size>:<threshold quality>)
#   MINLEN: Threshold length below which a read is dropped
# For Bowtie2:
#   REF_GENOME: Reference genome to which reads will be mapped
#   BOWTIE_PARAMS: "--nofw" to skip read alignment to forward reference strand
#                  "--norc" to skip read alignment to reverse reference strand
#   BOWTIE_THREADS: Number of parallel search threads to run

# DIFFERENTIAL GENE ANALYSIS #
##############################

# EXP: Concise name for the experiment (no whitespace)
# METHOD: "--et" Fisher's exact test (suitable for single factor experiments)
#         "--lrt" likelihood ratio test
#         "--qlf" quasi-likelihood test
# ANNOTATIONS: File containing gene annotations relevant to the experiment
# SAMPLES: File containing information on samples relevant to the experiment,
#          including library sizes and treatment groups
# JOBS: List of analyses to perform in the format "<job_1> <job_2> .. <job_n>",
#       where "<job_i>" = "<baseline_sample_i>,<treatment_sample_i>"
